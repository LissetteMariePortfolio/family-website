              manager. Just like an architect helps build roads and buildings, I
              help in creating digital products from the beginning. A product
              manager is one of the key people involved from the beginning. So I
              get to hear ideas, brainstorm with other industry leaders and
              build something that can potentially be life-altering for people."

              "I like to say that, as a PM, I try to do as much as I can so that
              my teammates can focus on what they like doing. Some people call
              this “filling whitespace”. I describe it this way because
              “whitespace” isn’t the same for different projects or groups of
              people. Everyone likes doing different things and has different
              strengths, which means the “whitespace” for each project and group
              of people will be different." <br />

              able to send out the public product launch announcement to signal
              the release of the version/product. The road to get there took
              months of development and testing, and the product likely went
              through many, probably contentious, rounds of design changes."

              " . . .[Y]ou often don’t have nearly as much decision-making
              ability as you might think. At most companies, where the product
              is core to the company, EVERYONE has an opinion on what the
              priorities, features, and user experience should be- sales,
              marketing, engineering, and often executives. Often times, a
              product manager ends up being more of an “order taker” from other
              stakeholders. Yet at the same time, the product manager is often
              held accountable for the success/failure of the product.
              Accountability without decision-making authority is incredibly
              frustrating. This definitely doesn’t happen at every company, but
              I’ve seen it plenty." Katie McCan, Byliner Product Leader

              " . . .“[M]anual work” due to the use of “poor tools.” The most
              common responses in this category related to “tedious” tasks like
              “offer management,” “segmentation work,” “campaign configuration,”
              “in-game event scheduling,” “creative optimization” for offers and
              user acquisition (UA), and “test coordination.” According to many
              PMs, these are the biggest time sinks, with many reporting that,
              on average, their team spends at least one day per week manually
              working on recurring offers and campaigns -- time that should be
              spent on other, more important and financially fruitful tasks. One
              PM from a big publisher said that he had to literally manually
              copy and paste over 70 JSON files per week to support campaigns in
              different locations. Another PM said that she had to set her alarm
              clock for early hours every weekend to log in to their live-ops
              console and manually hit the start button for events and
              accompanying currency sales in different time zones." <br />

              "Your engineers and designers don’t report to you. They will
              report to their own respective engineering/design managers. Your
              position becomes tricky in such a case. Often getting your ad-hoc
              work done would require you to maintain good rapport and
              understanding with the team. Often you would need to get work done
              from other teams or need their support on several small things. "

              "As a PM doing anything of significance, you will encounter
              resistance. It’s your job to respond appropriately to that
              resistance. For example, maybe a co-worker in Korea tells you the
              translation of your feature name is locally offensive — you have
              you to deal with that. Or maybe an executive emails at the last
              minute and tells you she doesn’t like some aspect of the design
              everyone already approved — you have to deal with that. As a PM,
              sometimes you’ll feel like you’re pushing a heavy train up a hill,
              and people are coming from everywhere putting obstacles on the

          Ultimately, the career of product management is an exciting one where
          you play a key role in the creation and development of the product.
          But that power leads you at risk for taking the fall if things fail,
          and you are left to make decisions without crucial information people
          in other roles might be given. Here are some links for further
