        <h2> Melanie Lei </h2>
        <p>
          
        Melanie Lei started off as an Account Manager in an EdTech startup. She became interested in working in product. She intended to leverage her deep understanding of her company's content creators and learners needs would give her an advantage. She was turned down for a PM role in her current company due to a lack of product experience. So she then focused on gaining experience doing the different tings a product manager typically did such as collecting feedback from users, prioritizing it based on business and consumer impact, and sharing that information with key decision makers. She understood the product her company offered deeply and fiercely advocated for new featurres for in-house technology that would help her coworkers. She prioritized marketing, writing, and product resources that would help her company grow. She also read many books while preparing for interviews to help her get a feel for the industry. She interviewed product managers she met to decide if she wanted to work at their company. Through that she figured out where she'd ideally want to work. She could also build her own story as a PM with their inspiration. She then started searching the market and figuring out her market worth. She then interviewed and evemtually landed a PM role! She is now a Momentive.ai Senior Product Manager.

    <h2> Clement Kao </h2>
    <p> 
     Clement Kao started off as an analyst, wanting to gain broad exposure to multiple industries. Part of his job was to train people to use the consulting company's SaaS. He became frustrated when he found bugs or UX flows that didn't make sense, cinsidering how difficult it would be for the user to navigate. The more difficult the SaaS was to use, the more loss of time the company encures.So he started proactively fixing the bugs and user flow errors and handed his work to the PM team. This sparked his interest in product management as a potentia; career path. Clement had already demonstated his skill in data analytics in his consulting job, so he aimed to get a job in product analytics, with the intention to eventually move into product management. He became a Principal Product Manager at Blend, and is a Co-Founder of Product HQ, a company that provides courses that prepare students for product management roles at top companies.
