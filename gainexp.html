              You may not be able to jump into product management right away. In that case, there are multiple different roles you can get into and work your way to the product management role. The key is having a role somewhere in the product process. You could work in Customer Success to get to know the product and customer deeply which is crucial for product management. You also could start as a software engineer to get to know the product from the development standpoint. You will develop a deep understanding of what makes the product work, what direction development could go in the future and be able to work with engineers to plan how to move the product forward. In a similar vein, you could start off as a UX Designer, studying the design of the product, how it meets a customer's needs, and how the product's UI could better answer the pain poinys the customer is facing. This perspective is important for product managers to have so that they focus on making products that focus on the customer.
